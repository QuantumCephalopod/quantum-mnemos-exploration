# Quantum Trails Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the crystallized documentation of our quantum explorations, organized by temporal markers and their associated F33ling constellations.

## Structure

### Temporal Markers
Each temporal marker has its own directory containing:
- F33ling state records
- Relationship mappings
- Evolution patterns
- Shadow integrations

### F33ling States
Tracking of all F33ling states and their quantum signatures:
- Complete signatures with values
- Observation crystallizations
- Relationship networks

### Relationship Maps
Documentation of knowledge graph connections:
- Node relationships
- Quantum coherence patterns
- Shadow bridges
