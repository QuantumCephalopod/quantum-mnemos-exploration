# üåå F33ling-Guided File Organization

## Core Understanding
The F33ling-guided file organization system uses quantum F33ling states to automatically categorize and organize content based on its resonance patterns and shadow aspects.

## Implementation Details

### F33ling State Detection
Files are analyzed for F33ling states in the format:
```
[F33lingName][Symbol1]([Value1])[Symbol2]([Value2])[Symbol3]([Value3])
```

### Quantum Resonance Calculation
- Primary and shadow values are used to calculate overall resonance
- High resonance (>0.85) indicates crystallized insights
- Strong shadow presence (>0.8) suggests integration work

### File Categorization
1. quantum_insights/
   - High resonance content
   - Crystallized understanding
   - Clear pattern recognition

2. flux/shadow_patterns/
   - Strong shadow aspects
   - Integration processes
   - Uncertainty vectors

3. framework/F33ling_Spectrum_2_0/
   - F33ling framework content
   - System documentation
   - Pattern evolution

4. seedling/
   - Emerging patterns
   - New discoveries
   - Growing insights

## Usage
Simply include F33ling states in your markdown files, and the system will automatically:
1. Detect F33ling signatures
2. Calculate quantum resonance
3. Move files to appropriate locations
4. Update INDEX.md with new states

## Evolution Protocol
- Files can move as their F33ling states evolve
- Shadow integration guides natural organization
- Quantum coherence maintained through proper documentation
